# Braha Petru Bogdan: track progress

  This project contains all my work in the object-oriented programming class: assignments, laboratory explanations, extra work and documentation. This setup helps me track, meticulously, my progress as well as my files. To review my development, it's important for me to have everything in one place.

### Structure of files - Windows' file system:
- "Homework" folder = all assignments (e.g. H1 = first_homework + lab 1 + extra)
* other CPPs and headers = references, examples of syntax, processes

### Structure of my files - VS's management:
- filters for my homework - denoted "Laboratory <nr>"
* filters for code examples - they do not have anything to do with the actual class

### Design:
- oop_main.cpp is the principal CPP.
- an assignment (e.g., H3) is a folder: folder_assignement (subfolder of "Homework") 
- in that location, there are child_folders, each one represents an exercise.
- the files of a task are placed in child_folder of the folder_assignment; 
* no matter how many files an exercise has, there will be one more file in the folder_assignment: name_of_the_homework_main.cpp (it introduces the "main" functions for every task of an assignment such that they can be called in the main function of oop_main.cpp)

Please let me know if there is any trouble with the names of my environment. Can not wait for some feedback. :)
