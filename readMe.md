# Braha Petru Bogdan: track progress

  This project contains all my work in the object-oriented programming class: assignments, laboratory explanations, extra work and documentation. This setup helps me track, meticulously, my progress as well as my files. To review my development, it's important for me to have everything in one place.
  To view my assignements access "oop" and "homework" directories (H1 = first homework).

### Design:
- oop.cpp is the principal CPP.
- an assignment, as H3, is a folder (subfolder of "homework").
- H3 has child-folders, each one represents an exercise.
- the files of a task are placed in child-folder of the folder-assignment.
* no matter how many exercises are there, there will be one more file in the folder-assignment: `name_of_the_homework_main.cpp` (it introduces the "main" functions for every task of an assignment such that they can be called in the main function of oop_main.cpp)

I'm looking for some feedback. Thank you.
